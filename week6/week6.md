## WEEK 6 - GROUP WORK

### Weekly goals

1. Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
2. Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
3. Run stand-ups and retrospectives
4. Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
5. Give and receive meaningful code review

### MakersBNB:

- Developer workflow
- Agile software dev tool
- Break specs down into user stories. Prioritise stories for MVP
- Acceptance criteria - Record the things that need to be done to consider each user story finished
- Pair picks user stories (full stack per user story)
- MVP? (most of headline specs) Get there by end Tues
- Rotate pairs every day
- 1 user story per day
- New git branch for every feature/user story (regularly pull in from master before pull request)
- Delete branch after merged in
