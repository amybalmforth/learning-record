### INTRO

- Understand THIS keyword
- Use callbacks correctly (how do they work? Write functions using callbacks)
- No Jasmine/JQuery
- What is a test framework really doing? Compare two things, check if true or false
- Write own tests without a testing library (jasmine/rspec github repo)
- Look @ practical for writing your own rspec (how does a test library actually work)
- Understand why difficult to write your own feature tests (focus on unit tests)

- DOM - programming interface for HTML and XML. Virtual object. Traversable. Represents the document as nodes and objects
- AJAX - Tool we used to make requests to a URL and get a response. Ajax help us manage that cycle in JS
- Front end routing, hash routing (i.e. share a tweet)
