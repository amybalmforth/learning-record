## WEEK 10 - TECH TESTS

### GOALS

* Can you solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code?

By "well crafted code", we mean code that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change.

Secondary goals

By the end of the week, you should:

* Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
* Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.

### INTRO

How to write clean well organised code:

- Easy to read and understand - explicit
- DRY
- Encapsulating - Expose only what you need and ensure classes know as little about each other as possible
- TDD - test behaviour not state (assert what method does, not value)
- SRP - Each method does only one thing
- Cohesion
- Good naming
- Regular commits - clear and concise - functionality that has been implemented
- Dependency injection - isolation in tests. feature envy? Refactoring guru (website)
- Easy to change. (Not hard coding)
- PLAN!!!
