#### WEEK 1

### Weekly goals

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
  - Concrete: use RSpec
  - Concepts: objects and methods
  - Process: TDD
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
  - Concrete: Pair with a different person each afternoon
  - Behaviour: Practise good pairing practise (driver navigator, ping-pong, one-upmanship)
3. Follow an effective debugging process
  - Concrete: Debug some code
  - Process: debugging methods
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
  - Concepts: OO, encapsulation, SRP

1. Test drive a simple program

Boris Bikes: Test drive Boris Bikes all week

Goals:

  - Explain what is needed to be done when setting up a new project with Rspec ***DONE***   

+ Describe the difference between unit tests and feature tests ***DONE***

+ Get into good habits with TDD
 - Write up notes from TDD workshop ***DONE***
 - Do a few more steps on the Roman Numerals program and spec ***DONE***

2. Pair using the driver-navigator style

Develop effective pairing technique while pairing with different people each afternoon

Goals:
+ Try to improve my pairing technique by the end of the week - Write down feedback from pairing sessions ***DONE***   
+ Understand Git better - Make a list of steps to follow with Git when starting a new project / collaborating with a new pair

***********************************************************

3. Follow an effective debugging process

Goals:

+ Debug a program - Complete "debugging approaches" practical exercise (Cipher Spec) ***CAN'T MANAGE IT***
+ Develop an effective debugging process - Write a list of simple steps to follow when debugging a program ***DONE***

***********************************************************

4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

Goals:

+ Find out what encapsulation is - Be able to describe to a fellow cohort member briefly what encapsulation is and what cohesion is ***DONE***
+ Find out what SRP is - Be able to write a short paragraph summing up what SRP is

***********************************************************

#### General goals for me to remember / improve on this week:

- Take clear notes in the skills workshops, with the aim of writing these up later, as a way to make sure I understand the concepts and keep a record

- Every time you learn something new i.e. in the pairing session, make a note of it and write up as a way of keeping a record

- Write small review of each pairing session including any interesting points learned

- PAIRING - Make a list of steps to follow with Git when starting a new project / collaborating with a new pair

- OO - Be able to write a short paragraph summing up what SRP is
